# Introduction

The aim of this library is to make the development of REST APIs using [express](https://expressjs.com/) and [mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/) as easy as possible. It provides useful methods to build a fully functional REST API in minutes. These methods can be used within any project based on `express` and `mongoose` and do not require any specific configuration.
